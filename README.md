# Weak-instruments
An investigation of the problems surrounding weak instrumental variables

This work is based on a paper by Bound et al. (1995) and discusses inconsistency and finite-sample bias in weak instrumental variables.

Some mathematical background is given and simulations are run in Python to provide evidence for the results. 

Finally, Angrist and Krueger (1991) is discussed as a case study in potential pitfalls of using weak instruments.
